# Find the provider of who.int
# simple answer is Cloudflare

IP=$(nslookup who.int | grep 'Address' | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $2}')
whois $IP

# use nslookup to get the ip address (in my case i got last Adress and printed it)
# then using 'whois' to get provider of given ip.
# whois works for every ip given.
